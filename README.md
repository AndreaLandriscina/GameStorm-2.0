# GameStorm 2.0

This application allows to access the vast database of IGDB. It allows the user to explore all the games in it, to view all the information about a game and to save all the games the user is interested in.
This application uses the "Model-View-ViewModel" with Repository pattern and uses "Retrofit" to make HTTP request and to convert the response into objects. It also uses "Room" to save data in the phone so that the app can be used offline. Finally, the authentication of the user is made through "Firebase".
